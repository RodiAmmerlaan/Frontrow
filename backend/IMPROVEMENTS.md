# Code Structure Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the structural improvements made to the FrontRow backend application to enhance maintainability, reduce code duplication, and improve separation of concerns.

## Backend Improvements

### 1. Utility Functions
Created shared utility modules to reduce code duplication:
- `src/utils/dateFilterUtils.ts` - Centralized date filtering logic for database queries

### 2. Service Layer
Introduced service layer to separate business logic from controllers:
- `src/services/events.service.ts` - Contains business logic for event operations

### 3. Shared Interfaces
Created shared TypeScript interfaces:
- `src/interfaces/event.interface.ts` - Event data structure definitions

### 4. Code Refactoring
Refactored existing code to use new structures:
- `src/controllers/events/events.dao.ts` - Now uses shared date filtering utilities
- `src/controllers/events/getAllEvents.controller.ts` - Now uses service layer

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Common functionality is now centralized in utility modules
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Changes to shared functionality only need to be made in one place
3. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Business logic is separated from data access and presentation layers
4. **Enhanced Type Safety**: Shared interfaces ensure consistency of data structures
5. **Scalability**: New features can be added more easily with the improved structure

## Future Improvements

1. **Additional Service Layers**: Create service layers for other entities (auth, orders, etc.)
2. **Error Handling**: Implement centralized error handling
3. **Validation**: Add input validation middleware
4. **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests for the new utility functions and service layers
5. **Documentation**: Expand documentation to cover all modules and components
6. **Logging**: Implement centralized logging for better debugging and monitoring
