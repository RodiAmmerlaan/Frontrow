    <h1>Frontend Fixes Test</h1>
    <p>We've made the following fixes to resolve the authentication issues:</p>
    
    <h2>Issues Identified and Fixed:</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Cookie Security Configuration</h3>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The refresh token cookie was being set with the Secure flag even in development mode, which prevented it from being sent over HTTP connections.</p>
    <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Modified the cookie.ts file to only set the Secure flag in production mode.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Frontend Authentication State Management</h3>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The frontend wasn't checking for the presence of the refresh token cookie on initial load, which meant that users who had previously logged in would appear logged out after refreshing the page.</p>
    <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Added cookie utility functions and modified App.tsx to check for the refresh token cookie on load and attempt to refresh the access token.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Profile Endpoint Request Handling</h3>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The fetchUserDetails function in App.tsx was not properly setting the access token before making requests to the profile endpoint.</p>
    <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Updated the fetchUserDetails function to properly set the access token in the API utility before making requests.</p>
    
    <h3>4. Response Format Handling</h3>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The frontend components were not correctly handling the response format from the backend API.</p>
    <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Updated the LoginPage and RegistrationPage components to properly extract the access token from the API responses.</p>
    
    <h2>How to Test the Fixes:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Restart the backend server</li>
        <li>Restart the frontend application</li>
        <li>Try logging in with the credentials:
            <ul>
                <li>Email: admin@frontrow.test</li>
                <li>Password: Admin123!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>After successful login, you should see "Welkom, Admin User" in the navigation bar</li>
        <li>Try refreshing the page - you should remain logged in</li>
        <li>Try accessing the profile endpoint - it should work without 401 errors</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Expected Results:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The "Welkom, username" message should appear after login</li>
        <li>The Registration/Login menu items should be hidden when logged in</li>
        <li>The profile endpoint should work without returning 401 errors</li>
        <li>Ticket purchasing functionality should be available when logged in</li>
    </ul>
